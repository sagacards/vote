            A parting veil, a whispered truth,<br />
            A turn into the secret and unknown<br />
            Her Lady sits, in silent contemplation,<br />
            On her sacred throne<br />
            <br />
            Dip into the stream of All<br />
            And slake your thirst for knowing<br />
            She murmurs, “Look, what it reveals!”<br />
            A path concealed, now showing<br />

            You already know the path to walk. THE HIGH PRIESTESS rules the realm of the subconscious, ready to illuminate the knowledge that lives inside of you. The pillars that lead to her sacred temple illustrate the duality of life; the moon at her feet illustrates her keen intuition. A sacred scroll, half-concealed, alludes to the truth that still needs to be explored, a mystery to be unveiled.<br />
            <br />
            THE HIGH PRIESTESS urges you to be still, and in this stillness of breath and body, you may hear what your intuition is trying to tell you, be it good or ill. Now is the time for trusting this secret inner voice, not to overthink or impulsively act. Some time is needed for solitary contemplation, to illuminate those secret, honest feelings that are stirring beneath the water's surface. When THE HIGH PRIESTESS makes herself known in your journey, great self-discovery—a tapestry parting—is about to happen.

        poem: <>
            Greener hills do stretch before you<br />
            A summer's sunlit golden glade<br />
            Earth to till, to reap, to sow,<br />
            It is your harvest you now lay<br />
            <br />
            A feast of sights and senses abound<br />
            The Mother opens her arms and draws you<br />
            Into the heart of her beating earth<br />
            Of which creation flows through<br />

            Divine Mother, Venus, ruler of the sensuous, of beauty, of rich earth, of creativity. THE EMPRESS sits in her golden fields, crowned by her golden hair, and enjoys the fruits of her joyful labour. She knows the seeds she sows make her harvest, and so she chooses only the seeds of love and care. THE EMPRESS is a powerful creative force. Some say she is depicted as with child, and while this message can be taken literally, it can also be taken as symbolic for a highly creative time in your life. <br />
            <br />
            Draw on your senses, explore them, excite them. Eat a carefully prepared meal or stretch out in silken sheets; THE EMPRESS is no stranger to luxury. As much as she allows you to indulge though, she also reminds you to spend time in the natural world, with good earth beneath your feet. Delight yourself, she says, and watch delight return to you tenfold. <br />

        poem: <>
            Dig down into that darkened earth <br />
            And meet the stern and solemn stone<br />
            Forge within you the iron, the steel,<br />
            To make, from adversity, your noble throne<br />
            <br />
            His Lord, The Father, The King of Kings,<br />
            The crown of thought, who shapes his way<br />
            Pulls out patterns from mind's flame <br />
            And from iron will does Fate obey<br />

            Carved from stony opposition sits THE EMPEROR's throne. Through years of lived experience, he has built an unshakable foundation, his force of will persisting through all obstacles. He is the Divine Father, the masculine counterpart to THE EMPRESS, fair and firm and fierce. A leader in every sense of the word, THE EMPEROR understands that there can be no stability in the world he rules until he rules his mind.<br />
            <br />
            Now is the time for determination to see all your desires through —to the very end. THE EMPEROR doesn't deal in half-measures or half-truths. He's not interested in partials. His presence is a reminder to be firm in your convictions now. Conflict is to be met with honesty and integrity, as well as a calm, strategic mind. You may feel a need to prove yourself, to show your worth; THE EMPEROR knows that all the proof of self you need is in the consistent, focused work you do. There cannot be just passion, but also persistence; the heart warms the hearth, the mind forges the steel and stone. <br />

            Come now, traveler, to the pontifex<br />
            Where the Sacred Revealer guides you<br />
            Bring with you the mind of learning<br />
            And find new faith on which to act through<br />
            <br />
            Bow low in reverent deference<br />
            And feel tradition in the halls that hold<br />
            Wisdom from ages and ages before<br />
            Shapes your Journey as it unfolds<br />

            The sacred revealer, pontifex between the physical and metaphysical, THE HIEROPHANT transmits his knowledge to all loyal disciples. He passes on his wisdom through convention and tradition, knowing that structure will provide the necessary support for those seeking his guidance. THE HIEROPHANT honours institution and values order and discipline. <br />
            <br />
            The path you walk is patterned and particular, dictated by surrounding social structures. Now is the time to embrace the orthodox. Tradition does not always have to stifle, and THE HIEROPHANT asks you to see what greater knowledge can be gained in the powerful institutions available to you. Be it the exploration of religion or the pull of academia, this card often means the presence of a great teacher, awaiting your arrival, ready to counsel.<br />
